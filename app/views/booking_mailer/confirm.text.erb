Sometimes we are otherwise engaged and don't get a chance to check the computer at regular intervals.

Here are some things you might like to know about staying with us:

* There are no individual tv's in rooms because most of our guests are here for 'recharging' purposes, 
in other words, enjoying the tranquility and simplicity of life. There are two lounges and one has TV/DVD.

* We have Wifi.

* Breakfast is not included but is available on request, 
we will confirm this with you when we confirm your booking.

Many thanks,

John and Dorothy
